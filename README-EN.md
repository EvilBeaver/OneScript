# README #

### The project is an independent cross-platform optn-source implementation of a virtual machine that executes scripts written in BSL (1C:Enterprise scripting language).

Script execution doesn't use any 1C:Enterprise system libraries and doesn't require installation of 1C:Enterprise system on the target machine.

In other words, this is a possibility to write programs in the 1C (BSL) language without using the 1C:Enterprise platform.
